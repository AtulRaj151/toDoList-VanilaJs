### Description
A simple Todo list with vanilla JS (as you see in the GIF below). Vanilla JS means no
plugins, no libraries, nothing.

### Features

- A text box at the top to add a todo item to the list.
- Add button: when a user clicks on the button, add that todo item to the list.
- A delete button to delete the todo item completely from the list.
- A checkbox to check the item off the list. (checked item should stay in the list, with some
differentiation from rest of the todo items)
